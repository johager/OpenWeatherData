# OpenWeatherData

This is the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp exercise Build Your Own App - API app.

The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays the current-conditions and 7-day forecast. Locations can be entered using an address or GPS coordinates.

The views are created programmatically: Interface Builder isn't used.

A custom URLSessionConfiguration is used to force weather data to always be downloaded instead of being read from cache.
